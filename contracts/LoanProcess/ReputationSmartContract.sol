* The Smart Reputation Contract is like a global score of an Ethereum address, and it can be used for many other purposes besides credit

* inevitably arises and exists in such an anonymous environment. The Smart Reputation Contract is the global equivalent of a Credit Score
* which exists in many countries around the world.
